# **Independent Sample Means Hypothesis Test**  

A **research company** is comparing two types of **cars** based on their **fuel consumption**. The following data has been collected:

## **Fuel Consumption Data**  

| **Metric**           | **Type A**           | **Type B**           |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Sample Size**      | 11                  | 10                  |
| **Mean Consumption** | 8.3 miles/L         | 9.6 miles/L         |
| **Standard Deviation** | 1.99 miles/L      | 2.37 miles/L       |

## **Tasks**  

### **(i) Hypothesis Testing at the 0.05 Level of Significance**  
Test whether **fuel consumption** is **the same** for **both types of cars**, using a **5% significance level**.

### **(ii) Hypothesis Testing with Larger Sample Sizes**  
If the **sample sizes** were changed to **110 for Type A** and **100 for Type B**, test again at a **5% significance level** to determine if **fuel consumption is the same** for both types of cars.
